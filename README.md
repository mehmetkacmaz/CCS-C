# PIC16F877 Projects Repository
Welcome to the PIC16F877 Projects Repository! This repository contains two distinct projects implemented on the PIC16F877 microcontroller using the C programming language. Each project focuses on different functionalities and showcases some techniques for microcontroller-based applications. Below, you will find a brief overview of each project:

## 1. Keypad Interface Project
The first project demonstrates an keypad interface implementation. It showcases how to interface a 4x4 matrix keypad with the PIC16F877 microcontroller. The code provided allows for efficient scanning of the keypad, enabling you to read the keys pressed accurately. The project utilizes the #use fast_io directive to optimize I/O operations for improved performance. Additionally, the provided code offers clear instructions on how to set up the hardware connections and initialize the necessary peripherals.

## 2. Digital Clock Project
The second project features an digital clock implementation. It utilizes a four-digit seven-segment LED display to show the current time. The code provided demonstrates how to set up the PIC16F877 microcontroller to generate accurate timekeeping using a crystal oscillator. By leveraging the microcontroller's I/O pins and utilizing the #use delay directive, the project efficiently updates the time on the LED display. The code is designed to provide a smooth and seamless experience, ensuring accurate timekeeping and visually appealing display output.
