Advanced Keypad Interface in PIC Microcontroller
This repository contains an advanced keypad interface implementation for PIC microcontrollers. The code provided demonstrates how to interface a 4x4 matrix keypad with a PIC microcontroller (specifically PIC16F877) using C language.

Hardware Setup
To replicate the keypad interface, you will need the following components:

PIC16F877 microcontroller
4x4 matrix keypad
Crystal oscillator (4MHz)
LEDs (optional, for visual feedback)
Make the necessary connections between the components as described below:

Connect the matrix keypad to the microcontroller's PORTB pins and define the pin assignments using the provided #define statements.
Connect the rows of the keypad to pins B0-B3 and the columns to pins B4-B7 of PORTB.
Connect the microcontroller's PORTD pins to LEDs for visual feedback (optional).
Software Implementation
The software code provided demonstrates an efficient method to read the keys pressed on the matrix keypad. Here's a brief overview of the main functions and their functionalities:

The keypad() function scans the matrix keypad for any key press and returns the corresponding key value.
The main() function initializes the microcontroller's peripherals and continuously reads the keypad input using an infinite loop.
To compile and run the code on a PIC16F877 microcontroller, follow these steps:

Set the necessary fuses using the provided #fuses directive.
Set the clock frequency to 4MHz using the #use delay(clock=4M) directive.
Initialize the necessary I/O pins using the #use fast_io directive.
Define the necessary pin assignments and variables using the provided #define statements.
Implement the keypad() function to read the keypad input.
Implement the main() function to initialize the peripherals and continuously read the keypad.
Remember to adjust the code according to your specific microcontroller and pin assignments if using a different model.
