Advanced Digital Clock using PIC Microcontroller
This repository contains an advanced digital clock implementation for PIC microcontrollers. The provided code demonstrates how to create a clock display on a four-digit seven-segment LED display using a PIC16F877 microcontroller.

Hardware Setup
To replicate the digital clock, you will need the following components:

PIC16F877 microcontroller
Four-digit seven-segment LED display
Crystal oscillator (4MHz)
Make the necessary connections between the components as described below:

Connect the four-digit seven-segment LED display to the microcontroller's PORTC pins.
Connect the common anode/cathode pins of the LED display to the microcontroller's PORTD pins.
Connect a crystal oscillator with a frequency of 4MHz to the microcontroller's OSC1 and OSC2 pins.
Software Implementation
The software code provided implements a digital clock that continuously updates the time on the four-digit LED display. Here's a brief overview of the main functions and their functionalities:

The main() function initializes the microcontroller's peripherals and continuously updates the time on the LED display using an infinite loop.
The time is stored in variables a, b, c, and d, representing the digits of the seconds and minutes. These variables are updated based on the elapsed time.
To compile and run the code on a PIC16F877 microcontroller, follow these steps:

Set the necessary fuses using the provided #fuses directive.
Set the clock frequency to 4MHz using the #use delay(clock=4M) directive.
Initialize the necessary I/O pins using the #use fast_io directive.
Define the seven-segment LED digit patterns using the const int digit[10] array.
Implement the main() function to initialize the peripherals and continuously update the time on the LED display.
Remember to adjust the code according to your specific microcontroller and pin assignments if using a different model.
